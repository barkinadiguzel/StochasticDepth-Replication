# StochasticDepth-Replication
This project replicates the Stochastic Depth technique on deep Residual Networks (ResNets), implementing random layer dropping during training to reduce effective depth and accelerate learning. The full network remains intact during testing, preserving model capacity while benefiting from implicit ensemble effects.
